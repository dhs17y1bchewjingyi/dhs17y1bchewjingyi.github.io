  <h1>Learning Journeys </h1>
 <p> Last week, I went to 3 learning journeys at MacRitchie Reservoir, Chinatown and the Natural History Museum. </p>
  <h2> Chinatown </h2>
  <p> I went to Chinatown on 17 May. It was very fun as I learnt more about the history of Chinatown and who helped to build it. I had not been there for a long time so it was interesting. </p>
   <h2>National History Museum </h2>
  <p> I went to the Lee Kong Chian National History Museum on 16th May. It was interesting as I had learnt more about the different types of animals and how they are classified. I also had a hands-on experience on how to classify the animals. It was very fun.</p>
